            <h1>üëã Say Goodbye To Schoology Lists!</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to abSENT! We're a mobile app that notifies Newton
                Public Schools students when their teachers are absent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Long gone are the mornings of scrolling through Schoology,
                praying that your teacher is absent, only to miss their name in
                a sea of absent teachers. Long gone are the times when you walk
                into your class, only to realize that your teacher is absent.
            </p>
            <p>With abSENT, these days are, well... <em>absent</em>.</p>

            <h1>üí° Inspiration</h1>
            <p>
                We got sick of having to check Schoology. The mobile interface
                is non-existent, the lists do not load on data (or even school
                WiFI!), and squinting to find your teacher in a list of 25 is
                just painful.
            </p>
            <p>Thus, abSENT was born.</p>

            <h1>üíΩ Features</h1>

                            data. No hard feelings.

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All this, and it's <em>completely free</em>. Free, free, free,
                free, free.
            </p>

            <h1>‚öôÔ∏è How It Works</h1>
            <p>
                It's pretty simple, really. Every morning, abSENT downloads the
                absence list from Schoology and sends it to your phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, the abSENT app compares it with your list of teachers and
                sends you a notification. That's it!
            </p>
