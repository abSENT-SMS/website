            <h1>What is it?</h1>
            <p>
                abSENT is a notification service written in Python, that sends
                you a notification whenever your teachers are abSENT. abSENT is
                a hobby project of
                <a href="https://rkarim.xyz">Roshan Karim</a> (NNHS '24),
                <a href="https://leah.vashevko.com">Leah Vashevko</a> (NSHS
                '24), and
                <a href="https://github.com/bykevinyang/">Kevin Yang</a> (NSHS
                '24), who got tired of refreshing a website constantly in the
                morning. Because of this inter-school colloboration, abSENT
                works for both North and South.
            </p>

            <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            <p>
                You download our mobile app and enter in class information.
                abSENT is completely free. Once we recieve all the information
                we need, we download the absence list every morning and let you
                know if your teachers are on it. For you, it's that simple!
            </p>

            <h1>Why do I need this?</h1>
            <p>
                After going to Newton High Schools and experiencing the absence
                list for two years, something had to be done. It's an annoying
                way of learning about absent teachers, it's often posted very
                late, and it's never posted at a consistent time. In the
                morning, when other things need to get done, this isn't
                acceptable. Thus, abSENT.
            </p>

            <h1>How can I help?</h1>
            <p>
                While the codebase is mostly in a maintenance state right now
                and help isn't needed with it, there are others ways to help.
                <a href="mailto:hello@absent.cc">React out to us</a> if you
                notice a bug or regression. And of course, if you can, donate to
                help us out with the server costs.
            </p>
